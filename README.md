# Apprentice theme for RStudio

# ![Apprentice](http://romainl.github.io/Apprentice/images/logo.png)

This is a port to RStudio of the Apprentice color scheme (called *themes* in
RStudio). [Apprentice is a dark, low-contrast colorscheme for
Vim](https://github.com/romainl/Apprentice). You can read all about it in the
official repo where @romainl maintains it. 

To install the Apprentice theme in RStudio open the Global Configurations menu
and press "add ..." to add a theme. Select the following file:

     Apprentice.rstheme

to install the theme.

I have tried to change the xterm colours as well, following the colors listed
by romainl in [the terminal ports of apprentice](https://github.com/romainl/apprentice-colorschemes)
but I'm not sure anything other than the background is changing. This needs
more tweaking and all suggestions and pull requests are welcome.

The TextMate file (`Apprentice.tmTheme`) was used initially as per the RStudio
instructions in the [blogpost about custom themes](https://blog.rstudio.com/2018/10/29/rstudio-ide-custom-theme-support/).
I have left it here just in case it is of use to anyone, but any changes will
be made in the `rstheme` file.
